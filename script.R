# Titanic data set
###################  

# load Titanic train ("data/train.csv") and test sets ("data/test.csv")

# Detecting missing values
###########################

# print the summary of the train set


# print the summary of the test set


# number of observations with empty Cabin variable



# get indices of observations with no Cabin value from the first class, in the train set



# get indices of observations with no Cabin value from the first class, in the test set



# set the Cabin value for identified passangers to NA in the train and test sets



# print the number of missing Cabin values in the train and test sets



# checking the presence of empty strings in character variables in the train set



# do the same in the test set 



# set the empty Embarked values to NA in the train set


#install.packages('Amelia')
# load Amelia library


# set the display area to show two plots in the same row 


# # use the missmap f. to visualise the missing data in the train set


# use the missmap f. to visualise the missing data in the test set


# revert the plotting area to the default (one plot per row)

# Handling missing values
###########################

###############################################################
## Categorical variables with a small number of missing values
###############################################################

# get the number of unique values for the Embarked variable in both sets



# create the contingency table for the values of the Embarked variable


# replace all NA values for the Embarked variable with 'S' in the train set


# print the contingency table for the values of the Embarked variable


# transform the Embarked variable into a factor in both sets



###############################################################
## Numerical variables with a small number of missing values
###############################################################

# test the Fare variable for normality


# get the class of the observation with missing Fare variable


# calculate the median value for the Fare variable of all passangers from the 3rd class



# set the median value to the Fare variable of the passanger with a missing Fare


# print the summary of the test set

## Examining the predictive power of variables from the data set
#################################################################

# transofrm the Sex variable into factor


# get the summary of the Sex variable


# compute the proportions table of the Sex variable


# create a contingency table for Sex vs. Survived



# compute the proportions for Sex vs. Survived


# transform the Survived variable into factor



# transform the Pclass variable into factor



# plot the number of passengers for different classes and Survived values



# add the Sex facet to the plot




# plot the number of passengers for different ports and Survived values




# examine the relation between Embarked and Survived, but with proportions




# examine the relation between Fare and Survived




######################
# Feature engineering
######################

# add the Survived variable to the test set


# transform the Pclass variable into factor (in the test set)



# transform the Sex variable into factor (in the test set)


# transform the Embarked variable into factor (in the test set)


# merge train and test sets

## Creating an age proxy variable
##################################

# print a sample of the Name variable


# split the name of the first observation on , or . characters


# split the name of the first observation on , or . characters and unlist


# split the name of the first observation on , or . characters, unlist and take the 2nd elem.


# create a variable Title based on the value of the Name variable 



# remove the leading space character from the Title


# print the contingency table for the Title values


# create a vector of all women (adult female) titles


# create a vector of all girl (young female) titles


# create a vector of all men (adult male) titles


# create a vector of all boy (young male) titles


# introduce a new character variable AgeGender


# set the AgeGender value based on the vector the Title value belongs to


# print the contingency table for the AgeGender values


# plot the distribution of the Age attribute in the Young_Female group


# plot the distribution of the Age attribute in the Adult_Male group



# print the number of young females who has the Age value set


# set the AgeGender to 'Adult_Female' for all 'girls' with age over 18




# print the number of adult males who has the Age value set


# set the AgeGender to 'Young_Male' for all 'Adult_Male' with age under 18



# print the contingency table for the AgeGender variable


# print the proportions table for the AgeGender variable


# transform the AgeGender to factor



# plot the AgeGender against Survived attribute



# calculate the proportions for AgeGender and Survived values



# transform the proportions table in a dataframe



# change the name of the columns to better reflect their meaning


# plot the AgeGender vs. Proportion vs. Survived



###################################
## Creating the FamilySize variable
###################################

# examine the values of the SibSp variable



# examine the values of the Parch variable



# create a new variable FamilySize based on the SibSp and Parch values



# print the contingency table for the FamilySize


# compute the proportion of FamilySize >= 3 in all passangers


# set the FamilySize to 3 to all observations where FamilySize > 3


# transform FamilySize into factor



# plot the FamilySize vs. Survived



#####################################
## Making use of the Ticket variable
#####################################

# print a sample of Ticket values


# compute the number of distinct values of the Ticket variable


# use tapply to compute the number of occurrences of each unique Ticket value 



# create a data frame with ticket name and ticket count as variables



# print first few rows of the new data frame


# print the contingency table of the count variable


# merge titanic.all and ticket.count.df datasets on the Ticket variable



# change the name of the newly added column to PersonPerTicket



# print the contingency table of the PersonPerTicket variable


# set the PersonPerTicket to 4 to all observations where PersonPerTicket > 4


# convert PersonPerTicket to factor



# print the contingency table for the PersonPerTicket


# print the contingency table for the PersonPerTicket vs. FamilySize


# plot all survived passangers (without NAs)


# calculate the proportions of the PersonPerTicket vs. Survived table



# convert the table into a data frame


# change the name of the last column to better reflect its meaning


# plot the PersonPerTicket vs. Proportion barchart, split based on the Survived attribute


##################################
# Save the augmented data set
##################################

# split into train and test set based on whether the Survived is present



# save both data sets to a file
